# DUBLIN-BIKES-ANALYSIS-USING-PYTHON-PROGRAMMING
**Work Division:**
This Project was done in pairs by myself(Abusomwan Amadevborho) and James Idowu

**Dataset:**
The primary data source is the real-time bike data and available from the api
hosted by JCDecaux.However, We augment this dataset with other relevant secondary data
scraped from the web. Nevertheless, the majority of the data should was the real-time bike data.

**Overview:**
After signing up, receiving a key and reviewing the columns available / workings of the api, We created
a plan for the analysis i.e. what aspects of global bike usage taking place during the period of
completing this assignment which I was interested in learning more about. We further developed a Jupyter notebook
that addresses the analysis set out in the plan. The final dataset used for the analysis
contained lots of data i.e. not just a single call to the API. 

**Task 1 - Developed Plan:**
The plan was to outline goals of the analysis and comprise a series of related questions (or
hypotheses) which interested we were inquisitive in finding answers.

**Task 2 - Collect data:**
The real-time data from the api represented the state of the biking system in Dublin at a
given moment in time. 

**Task 3 - Structure of the Notebook:**
The Jupyter notebook for task 3 was structured as follows:
1.) Included the plan at the top / beginning of the notebook.
2.) The body of the notebook contained analysis work to carry out the plan and
be presented.
3.) At the end of the notebook we made conclusion, discussing how the results of
the analysis compare with the goals set out in the plan.
